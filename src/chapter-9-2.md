Taking breaks and allowing yourself to rest is crucial for avoiding burnout. Schedule regular breaks throughout your writing day, and make sure to take time off when needed to recharge your batteries.

Practicing mindfulness can help you stay present and focused while writing, which can in turn lead to increased productivity and reduced stress. Consider incorporating practices like meditation or deep breathing exercises into your daily routine.
